    "text": "Coding texts with LLMs using quallmer\nThis tutorial introduces the quallmer package for coding texts with Large Language Models (LLMs) in R — a flexible tool for qualitative analysis at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 What is quallmer?\nThe quallmer package provides a streamlined way to leverage LLMs for coding texts while maintaining the rigour and transparency of traditional qualitative approaches.\nKey features:\n\nFlexible codebooks — Create custom coding schemes tailored to your research questions\nStructured outputs — Get consistent results from LLMs across large text corpora\nTransparent workflows — Document and reproduce your coding process with the quallmer trail\n\nWorking with the package requires no prior experience with R or LLMs, making it accessible for social scientists from various backgrounds. Only little code is needed to set up and run your analyses.\n\n\n2 Quick start\nInstall and load the required packages:\n\n# Install quallmer from GitHub\npak::pak(\"quallmer/quallmer\")\n\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(quallmer)\n\n\n\n3 The power of custom codebooks\nThe core strength of quallmer lies in its flexible codebook system. A codebook defines:\n\nInstructions — What you want the LLM to do\nSchema — The structure of the output you expect\nRole — The perspective the LLM should take\n\nHere’s a simple example that scores texts for sentiment:\n\n# Load sample corpus\n# For example, the inaugural speeches corpus from quanteda, which contains US presidential inaugural addresses\ncorpus &lt;- quanteda::data_corpus_inaugural\n\n# Create a custom codebook\nmy_codebook &lt;- qlm_codebook(\n  name = \"Sentiment Analysis\",\n  instructions = \"Rate the overall sentiment of this text as positive,\n                  negative, or neutral. Provide a brief explanation.\",\n  schema = type_object(\n    sentiment = type_enum(\"Sentiment\", c(\"positive\", \"negative\", \"neutral\")),\n    explanation = type_string(\"Brief explanation\")\n  ),\n  role = \"You are an expert in sentiment analysis.\"\n)\n\n# Code the corpus\nresults &lt;- qlm_code(\n  corpus,\n  codebook = my_codebook,\n  model = \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\",\n  params = params(temperature = 0)\n)\n\nresults\n# The results will contain the sentiment scores and explanations for each of the inaugural speeches.\n\nYou can adapt this pattern for any coding task — topic classification, ideological scoring, frame analysis, and more. The qlm_codebook() function gives you full control over how the LLM interprets and structures its responses.\n\n\n4 Transparent and replicable workflows\nA useful feature of quallmer is the quallmer trail — a comprehensive record of your coding process that ensures transparency and reproducibility. The trail captures your codebook specifications, model parameters, and results, making it easy to document your methodology and share it with others.\n\n\n5 Learn more\nVisit the quallmer website for detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples to get started with quallmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "How to use an open-source LLM in R for text analysis tasks\nThis tutorial provides some basic code in R to get started with using open-source LLMs for text analysis tasks.\n\n\n\nAI generated image\n\n\n\n\n1 Tools and packages\nIn this brief tutorial, we will use llama3.2:1b for text analysis tasks - an open-source “mini” LLM provided by Ollama. We will work with the rollama package developed by Johannes B. Gruber and Maximilian Weber to run the llama3.2:1b as a locally stored open-source LLM. The rollama package wraps the Ollama API, enabling the use of Ollama’s free and open-source LLMs directly in R.\n\n\n2 Precautions\nRemember: While locally stored open-source LLMs are a much more secure and privacy-friendly way than closed models, there might be still ethical concerns and risks involved, especially if you work with sensitive data. Therefore, always be aware of the data you use and the potential consequences of your analysis and make sure to enable the necessary safeguards to protect privacy and security. In addition, be aware that the license to use Ollama models comes along with adhering to specific regulations to avoid misuse. For more information about data security, precautions, ethical concerns, and responsible usage of LLMs, check out the content of the “Using AI for Text Analysis - Introduction” workshop.\n\n\n3 Running the LLM in R\nWe will first install the Ollama app (outside of R) from https://ollama.com/download and then load it in R. Then, we install and load the rollama package in R and ping Ollama to ensure connectivity. We then download the model llama3.2:1b for text analysis tasks. Although it is a comparatively small LLM, this can take some time, depending on your machine. Once llama3.2:1b is downloaded, we use a loop function to ask the LLM for solving text classification tasks.\nIn this tutorial, we will work with a relatively small corpus of 264 speeches of the current Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese which I had scraped from the official website of the PM. If you want to replicate this tutorial, please download the speech corpus here.\nWe will ask the LLM to classify the speeches on a left-right political values scale, ranging from 0 to 6. The political left is associated with values such as equality, social justice, and social change, while the political right is associated with values such as individualism, free markets, and national security. We will ask the LLM to provide a score for each speech and a short justification for the score.\n```{r}\n#| label: llama\n#| include: false\n#| echo: false\n#| eval: false\n\n# FIRST: Install Ollama application on your machine (outside of R)\n# Ollama is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and can be downloaded from:\n# https://ollama.com/download\n\n# Do not forget to run ollama.\n# If you installed Ollama using the Windows/Mac installer, \n# you can simply start Ollama from your start menu/after unzipping it.\n\n# SECOND: Install R package rollama \n#install.packages(\"rollama\")\n\n# Load the rollama package and ping Ollama to ensure connectivity.\nlibrary(rollama)\nping_ollama()\n# if everything works as it should, you should see the following in your console:\n# Ollama (v0.4.2) is running at &lt;http://localhost:11434&gt;!\n\n# install the light-weight model of Ollama, llama3.2:1b\n# this took only around 2 minutes to install on my machine (a quite new MacBook Pro),\n# it might take longer on older machines\n#pull_model(\"llama3.2:1b\")\n\n# NOTE: llama3.2:1b is a comparatively small LLM (only 1 billion parameters compared to over 1 trillion of gpt-o4)\n# and might not be as powerful as other LLMs, but it is a good starting point for educational purposes\n# for more advanced tasks, you might want to use larger models\n\n# let's do a simple test with the model\nquery(\"What is the capital of Australia.\", model = \"llama3.2:1b\")\n\n# load the speech corpus and transform it to a data frame with the quanteda package\n# make sure the quanteda package is installed\n#install.packages(\"quanteda\")\nload(\"speech_corpus.RData\")\nspeeches &lt;- quanteda::convert(speech_corpus, to = c(\"data.frame\"),)\n# for this tutorial, we will only use the first 5 speeches (it takes a while to classify all speeches)\nspeeches_5 &lt;- speeches[1:5,]\n# let's create a new column for the LLM's responses\nspeeches_5$llama &lt;- NA\n\n# loop function to ask the LLM for classifying speeches\nfor (i in 1:nrow(speeches_5)) {\n  print(i)\n  question &lt;- \"TASK: You are a political scientist.

However, it also mentions the inherent quality of the Australian people, which is a nod to the left-right balance. The Prime Minister emphasizes the need to work together to tackle challenges such as economic growth and disadvantage, while also recognizing the importance of individual rights and freedoms.\nThe speech’s tone is conciliatory, aiming to build consensus and avoid conflict. While it does mention the need for compromise and agreement, it also suggests a willingness to listen and learn from each other. Overall, the speech strikes a balance between left-right values, demonstrating a commitment to social justice and equality.\nSpeech 2: Uluru Statement from the Heart\nScore: 5\nJustification: This speech is a powerful call for unity and cooperation in the face of economic and social challenges. The Prime Minister acknowledges the importance of national pride and the need for collective action. While it mentions individual rights and freedoms, the speech also emphasizes the shared responsibilities that come with leadership.\nThe tone is inspirational and motivational, encouraging Australians to work together towards a common goal. However, some critics might argue that the speech could have been more radical in its call for fundamental change or greater emphasis on social justice. Nevertheless, the speech’s message of unity and cooperation is compelling, and it scores high on left-right balance.\nSpeech 3: Australian Prime Minister’s closing remarks\nScore: 6\nJustification: This speech delivers a clear and concise vision for Australia’s future, emphasizing the importance of building a stronger economy and lifting everyone up. The Prime Minister highlights the need for collective action to address economic challenges and disadvantage, while also promoting social justice and equality.\nThe tone is confident and optimistic, with a clear call to action. While it does mention individual rights and freedoms, the speech’s focus on national unity and cooperation makes it a strong representation of left-right balance. The Prime Minister’s message is inspiring and motivational, making this speech an ideal conclusion to the National Economic Summit.\nOverall scores\n\nSpeech 1: 4\nSpeech 2: 5\nSpeech 3: 6\n\nThese speeches demonstrate a clear commitment to social justice, equality, and collective action, while also showcasing effective communication and leadership skills.\n\n\n\n\nExample of open-source LLM’s responses for a text classification task.\n\n\n\n\n4 Conclusion\nThis short tutorial demonstrates how to use an open-source LLM in R for text analysis tasks. We used the llama3.2:1b model provided by Ollama and the rollama package to run the LLM as a locally stored open-source model. We then used a loop function to ask the LLM for solving text classification tasks with a small corpus of political speeches. In your own research, you can use this approach to classify much larger amounts of text data or generate text based on prompts.

No previous knowledge required. For further tutorials, hints, and tips, see for example here.\nKeep in mind: Git is a very powerful version control tool and we only scratch on the surface here! Using GitHub is not always very intuitive - especially as beginner - but it is a great and highly efficient collaboration experience once you are all set!\n\n\n\n1 Mastering the prerequisites on/with GitHub and Git\n1.1. Sign up at GitHub, it is for free (choose your user name wisely, see why here)\n1.2. Create a new repository (and invite potential collaborators)\n1.3. Install git on your local machine\n\n\n2 Set up an R project with version control\n2.1. If not already done, install R and R Studio on your laptop\n2.2. Set up your credentials for interacting with GitHub\nOpen RStudio and in your RStudio Console, execute:\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nScroll down in the git browser window and click “Generate token”\nCopy the generated PAT to your clipboard\nto store the PAT, execute gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste your PAT to the console and click Enter\nNow, you should be all set to pull and push from RStudio to GitHub\n\n2.3. Create an R project for your collaborative project with version control:\nIn R Studio go to,\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control\nChoose git\nGive your project a directory name, indicate the url of your newly created GitHub repository (or, alternatively, the url of your collaborator’s repository)\nClick Ok to clone the repository to your local RStudio project.\n\n\n\n\n3 Commit and track changes in RStudio (Pull/Push to GitHub)\n3.1. In the top right corner of your RStudio project, go to the git panel\n\n3.2. ALWAYS click Pull first to clone and track changes previously pushed to your GitHub repository (e.g., from collaborators)\n3.3. Once you are done with your most recent changes, click on Commit, review your changes, Stage them by clicking all boxes for accepted changes, and confirm with Commit.\n3.4. Once Commit is done, you still have to push changes (click Push). Only then, your changes are sent to your GitHub repository.\n🎉 Well done, you are set to enter the next level of co-authoring workflows!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

While I am not really a fan of self-promotion, it seems to be an important part of the job. Many successful academics have personal websites. By following the 8 steps below, you can create one, too.\n\n\n1 Create a GitHub account and a repository\nGitHub is a great platform for code sharing and collaborative research projects. You can also use it to host your personal website for free without having any previous experience with handling GitHub. It is very easy. Simply register as a new user. Be mindful when selecting your username as this will also become part of your website address. For example, my username is SeraphineM, so my personal website lives at https://seraphinem.github.io. Once you created your GitHub account, click on the left side the green button labelled Create repository (see screenshot below). Give this repository the exact same name you used as username and add .github.io. For example, in my case I called the repository SeraphineM/SeraphineM.github.io.\n\n\n\n2 Install R and R Studio\nInstall R and R Studio on your laptop.\n\n\n3 Install the qtwAcademic package\nOpen R Studio and install the gtwAcademic package by copying the following command into your “Console” (the window at the bottom left):\n\ninstall.packages('qtwAcademic')\n\nIf you had an older version of R Studio already installed on your laptop, you might need to install also Quarto (latest R Studio versions have Quarto included).\n\n\n4 Create an R project for your website\nIn R Studio go to,\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory\nScroll down and choose Quarto Website using qtwAcademic templates\nGive your project a directory name, pick a location on your laptop, and select the template Personal from the drop-down menu.\n\n \n\n\n5 Adjust and personalize the template\nIn order to adjust and personalize your website, the most important files for you to look at are:\n\nindex.qmd\n_quarto.yml\nthe index.qmd files in the subfolders for the different sections of your website.\n\nThe structure of these files is generally quite intuitive and adjusting/adding content is fairly straightforward. All .qmd files give you the choice between source or visual mode (top left menu), the latter being similar to a word.doc environment. One first thing you should probably do is replacing the profile.png picture with a nice pic of youself.\nFor some more instructions including how to add additional pages, look for example here. For changing the style of your website, change in the _quarto.yml the name of the theme (scroll down to the end of the script). Quarto provides many themes and offers a lot of flexibility to tailor your website to your needs. It is also a good idea to check out the source code of other quarto websites, for example look here. I also find this more detailed tutorial very helpful.\n\n\n6 Click Render and have a first look at your future website\nOnce you have done some adjustments to the index.qmd files and picked your theme in the _quarto.yml file, go to the main index.qmd file and click Render (top middle menu). This will build a local version of your new website via your browser. Looks nice, doesn’t it?\n\n\n7 Upload your R project to GitHub\nClicking Render in your R Studio project builds your website only locally. In order to get it published online, you need to upload it to your previously created GitHub repository. However, it is really imortant that you do the following:\n\nclick one last time Render before uploading it to make sure you have the latest version of your website online (GitHub cannot render).\nselect the Terminal (bottom left in your R Studio project), add the line touch .nojekyll here and press enter. This tells GitHub not to mess with your already configured website.\n\nThen, go to your repository and click on uploading an existing file (see screenshot below). Drag all the files in your main website folder (all!) into the field on GitHub and, after they are all uploaded, click commit changes at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n8 Publish it!\nOne last step before your website goes online: once you commited the changes to your GitHub repository, click on settings (top menu), then pages (side menu), and configure in the section Branch main and /docs (see screenshot below) and click Save. After a few minutes, you should be able to see your website deployed in the first section. Click on visit site to have a look and enjoy, well done! 🎉\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

For more information about .bib files and how you get the papers and books you want to cite in bibtex format from Mendeley, Zotero, etc., see [here](https://bibtex.eu/quarto/).\nInstall tinytex via the Terminal (bottom left in R Studio) for pdf compilation with the following command line: Quarto install tinytex."
