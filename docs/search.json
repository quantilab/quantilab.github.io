    "text": "How to use GitHub for collaborative RStudio projects\nIn this highly simplified 3-step tutorial, we will provide a minimal guide on how to use the online platform GitHub for collaborative RStudio projects, i.e., to share code, data, and replication material or to collectively work on a research paper project. No previous knowledge required. For further tutorials, hints, and tips, see for example here.\nKeep in mind: Git is a very powerful version control tool and we only scratch on the surface here! Using GitHub is not always very intuitive - especially as beginner - but it is a great and highly efficient collaboration experience once you are all set!\n\n\n\n1 Mastering the prerequisites on/with GitHub and Git\n1.1. Sign up at GitHub, it is for free (choose your user name wisely, see why here)\n1.2. Create a new repository (and invite potential collaborators)\n1.3. Install git on your local machine\n\n\n2 Set up an R project with version control\n2.1. If not already done, install R and R Studio on your laptop\n2.2. Set up your credentials for interacting with GitHub\nOpen RStudio and in your RStudio Console, execute:\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nScroll down in the git browser window and click ‚ÄúGenerate token‚Äù\nCopy the generated PAT to your clipboard\nto store the PAT, execute gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste your PAT to the console and click Enter\nNow, you should be all set to pull and push from RStudio to GitHub\n\n2.3. Create an R project for your collaborative project with version control:\nIn R Studio go to,\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control\nChoose git\nGive your project a directory name, indicate the url of your newly created GitHub repository (or, alternatively, the url of your collaborator‚Äôs repository)\nClick Ok to clone the repository to your local RStudio project.\n\n\n\n\n3 Commit and track changes in RStudio (Pull/Push to GitHub)\n3.1. In the top right corner of your RStudio project, go to the git panel\n\n3.2. ALWAYS click Pull first to clone and track changes previously pushed to your GitHub repository (e.g., from collaborators)\n3.3. Once you are done with your most recent changes, click on Commit, review your changes, Stage them by clicking all boxes for accepted changes, and confirm with Commit.\n3.4. Once Commit is done, you still have to push changes (click Push). Only then, your changes are sent to your GitHub repository.\nüéâ Well done, you are set to enter the next level of co-authoring workflows!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "How to code your own personal website with Quarto in less than 30 minutes and for free!\nThis tutorial provides a focused guide on how to code and publish your own personal website with Quarto and GitHub. No previous knowledge required. Shouldn‚Äôt take longer than 30 minutes (basic version).\n\n\n\nAs an academic, I often feel like I am working as a freelancer. While I am not really a fan of self-promotion, it seems to be an important part of the job. Many successful academics have personal websites. By following the 8 steps below, you can create one, too.\n\n\n1 Create a GitHub account and a repository\nGitHub is a great platform for code sharing and collaborative research projects. You can also use it to host your personal website for free without having any previous experience with handling GitHub. It is very easy. Simply register as a new user. Be mindful when selecting your username as this will also become part of your website address. For example, my username is SeraphineM, so my personal website lives at https://seraphinem.github.io. Once you created your GitHub account, click on the left side the green button labelled Create repository (see screenshot below). Give this repository the exact same name you used as username and add .github.io. For example, in my case I called the repository SeraphineM/SeraphineM.github.io.\n\n\n\n2 Install R and R Studio\nInstall R and R Studio on your laptop.\n\n\n3 Install the qtwAcademic package\nOpen R Studio and install the gtwAcademic package by copying the following command into your ‚ÄúConsole‚Äù (the window at the bottom left):\n\ninstall.packages('qtwAcademic')\n\nIf you had an older version of R Studio already installed on your laptop, you might need to install also Quarto (latest R Studio versions have Quarto included).\n\n\n4 Create a R project for your website\nIn R Studio go to,\n\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory\nScroll down and choose Quarto Website using qtwAcademic templates\nGive your project a directory name, pick a location on your laptop, and select the template Personal from the drop-down menu.\n\n \n\n\n5 Adjust and personalize the template\nIn order to adjust and personalize your website, the most important files for you to look at are:\n\nindex.qmd\n_quarto.yml\nthe index.qmd files in the subfolders for the different sections of your website.\n\nThe structure of these files is generally quite intuitive and adjusting/adding content is fairly straightforward. All .qmd files give you the choice between source or visual mode (top left menu), the latter being similar to a word.doc environment. One first thing you should probably do is replacing the profile.png picture with a nice pic of youself.\nFor some more instructions including how to add additional pages, look for example here. For changing the style of your website, change in the _quarto.yml the name of the theme (scroll down to the end of the script). Quarto provides many themes and offers a lot of flexibility to tailor your website to your needs. It is also a good idea to check out the source code of other quarto websites, for example look here. I also find this more detailed tutorial very helpful.\n\n\n6 Click Render and have a first look at your future website\nOnce you have done some adjustments to the index.qmd files and picked your theme in the _quarto.yml file, go to the main index.qmd file and click Render (top middle menu). This will build a local version of your new website via your browser. Looks nice, doesn‚Äôt it?\n\n\n7 Upload your R project to GitHub\nClicking Render in your R Studio project builds your website only locally. In order to get it published online, you need to upload it to your previously created GitHub repository. However, it is really imortant that you do the following:\n\nclick one last time Render before uploading it to make sure you have the latest version of your website online (GitHub cannot render).\nselect the Terminal (bottom left in your R Studio project), add the line touch .nojekyll here and press enter. This tells GitHub not to mess with your already configured website.\n\nThen, go to your repository and click on uploading an existing file (see screenshot below). Drag all the files in your main website folder (all!) into the field on GitHub and, after they are all uploaded, click commit changes at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n8 Publish it!\nOne last step before your website goes online: once you commited the changes to your GitHub repository, click on settings (top menu), then pages (side menu), and configure in the section Branch main and /docs (see screenshot below) and click Save. After a few minutes, you should be able to see your website deployed in the first section. Click on visit site to have a look and enjoy, well done! üéâ"
