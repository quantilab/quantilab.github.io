# Welcome to QuantLab

**QuantLab** is a network bringing together social scientists at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences) and beyond to share insights in quantitative methods and research.

Co-founded by [Seraphine F. Maerz](https://seraphinem.github.io) (Political Science) and [Irma Mooi-Reci](https://irmamooireci.com/) (Sociology), QuantLab is an inclusive network that welcomes everyone — from students to established researchers — interested in learning about quantitative methods and computational techniques.

We offer hands-on seminars where you can learn cutting-edge methods, [free online tutorials](blog.qmd) with step-by-step guides on data management and reproducible research, and a [code repository](https://github.com/quantilab/sharezone/tree/main) with ready-to-use scripts in R, Stata, and Python (work in progress). Most importantly, we provide a space to connect with fellow students and researchers, share ideas as well as knowledge, and collaborate.
