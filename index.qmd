# Welcome!

*Quantlab* is a new network group aiming to bring together social scientists at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences) and beyond to share insights in quantitative methods and research.

Co-founders: Seraphine F. Maerz [Seraphine F. Maerz](https://sites.google.com/view/seraphinemaerz/about) (Political Science) and Irma Mooi-Reci [Irma Mooi-Reci](https://irmamooireci.com/) (Sociology).

We are an inclusive network and welcome everyone interested in learning (more) about new quantitative methods and computational techniques. We believe in knowledge sharing and offer [learning seminars](seminars24/index.qmd) as well as [online tutorials](blog.qmd) about innovations in data management and analysis, and a platform for [code sharing](gitlink.qmd) (R, Stata, Python, R Markdown, LaTeX, Quarto).

Come join us for our bi-weekly *Quantlunches*, [RSVP here!](mailto:seraphine.maerz@unimelb.edu.au)
