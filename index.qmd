# Welcome!

*QuantLab* is a new network group aiming to bring together social scientists at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences) and beyond to share insights in quantitative methods and research.

Co-founded by [Seraphine F. Maerz](https://seraphinem.github.io) (Political Science) and [Irma Mooi-Reci](https://irmamooireci.com/) (Sociology), *QuantLab* is an inclusive network that welcomes everyone interested in learning (more) about new quantitative methods and computational techniques. We believe in knowledge sharing and offer [learning seminars]() (schedule below) as well as [free online tutorials](blog.qmd) about innovations in data management and analysis, and a platform for exchange and code sharing (R, Stata, Python, etc.). 

We collaborate with [Instats](https://instats.org/) to provide online training sessions on the latest tools and techniques in quantitative research, see our instats workshops [here](https://instats.org/expert/quantlab?exmode=true).

Come and join us for our *Quant events* on the campus of the University of Melbourne, [RSVP here!](mailto:seraphine.maerz@unimelb.edu.au)
