No previous knowledge required. Shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes (basic version).*\n\n![](thumbnail.png)\n\n\\\n\nAs an academic, I often feel like I am working as a freelancer. While I am not really a fan of self-promotion, it seems to be an important part of the job. Many successful academics have personal websites. By following the 8 steps below, you can create one, too.\n\n# Create a GitHub account and a repository\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great platform for code sharing and collaborative research projects. You can also use it to host your personal website for free without having any previous experience with handling GitHub. It is very easy. Simply register as a new user. **Be mindful when selecting your username** as this will also become part of your website address. For example, my username is *SeraphineM*, so my personal website lives at <https://seraphinem.github.io>. Once you created your GitHub account, click on the left side the green button labelled `Create repository` (see screenshot below). Give this repository the exact same name you used as username and add `.github.io`. For example, in my case I called the repository `SeraphineM/SeraphineM.github.io`.\n\n![](rep1.png){width=30%}\n\n# Install R and R Studio\n\nInstall [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads) on your laptop.\n\n# Install the qtwAcademic package\n\nOpen R Studio and install the [gtwAcademic package](https://github.com/andreaczhang/qtwAcademic) by copying the following command into your \"Console\" (the window at the bottom left):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('qtwAcademic')\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you had an older version of R Studio already installed on your laptop, you might need to install also [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) (latest R Studio versions have Quarto included).\n\n# Create a R project for your website\n\nIn R Studio go to,\n\n1.   File \\> New Project \\> New Directory \n\n2.  Scroll down and choose `Quarto Website using qtwAcademic templates`\n\n3.  Give your project a directory name, pick a location on your laptop, and select the template `Personal` from the drop-down menu.\n\n![](proj1.png){width=30%}\n![](proj2.png){width=30%}\n\n# Adjust and personalize the template\n\nIn order to adjust and personalize your website, the most important files for you to look at are:\n\n- `index.qmd`\n- `_quarto.yml`\n- the `index.qmd` files in the subfolders for the different sections of your website.\n\nThe structure of these files is generally quite intuitive and adjusting/adding content is fairly straightforward. All `.qmd` files give you the choice between `source` or `visual` mode (top left menu), the latter being similar to a word.doc environment. One first thing you should probably do is replacing the `profile.png` picture with a nice pic of youself. \n\nFor some more instructions including how to add additional pages, look for example [here](https://andreaczhang.github.io/qtwAcademic/articles/qtwAcademic.html). For changing the style of your website, change in the `_quarto.yml` the name of the `theme` (scroll down to the end of the script). [Quarto provides many themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) and offers a lot of flexibility to tailor your website to your needs. It is also a good idea to check out the source code of other quarto websites, for example look [here](https:github.com/seraphinem/seraphinem.github.io). I also find [this more detailed tutorial](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/) very helpful. \n\n# Click `Render` and have a first look at your future website\n\nOnce you have done some adjustments to the `index.qmd` files and picked your theme in the `_quarto.yml` file, go to the main `index.qmd` file and click `Render` (top middle menu). This will build a local version of your new website via your browser. Looks nice, doesn't it?\n\n# Upload your R project to GitHub\n\nClicking `Render` in your R Studio project builds your website only locally. In order to get it published online, you need to upload it to your previously created GitHub repository. However, it is really imortant that you do the following:\n\n- click one last time `Render` before uploading it to make sure you have the latest version of your website online (GitHub cannot render). \n- select the `Terminal` (bottom left in your R Studio project), add the line `touch .nojekyll` here and press enter. This tells GitHub not to mess with your already configured website.\n\nThen, go to your repository and click on `uploading an existing file` (see screenshot below). Drag all the files in your main website folder (all!) into the field on GitHub and, after they are all uploaded, click `commit changes` at the bottom of the page. \n\n![](rep2.png){width=50%}\n\n# Publish it!\n\nOne last step before your website goes online: once you commited the changes to your GitHub repository, click on `settings` (top menu), then `pages` (side menu), and configure in the section Branch `main` and `/docs` (see screenshot below) and click `Save`. After a few minutes, you should be able to see your website deployed in the first section. Click on `visit site` to have a look and enjoy, well done! ðŸŽ‰\n\n![](rep3.png){width=50%}\n",
