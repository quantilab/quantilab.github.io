No previous knowledge required. The tutorial covers only the very basics to get started with writing nice papers using Quarto. For further tutorials, hints, and tips, see for example [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).*\n\n![](thumbnail.png)\n\n\\\n\nAs a researcher, I love collaborative paper writing processes with efficient workflows. Quarto is the [next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) and is really a great tool for this. Follow the four steps below to get started with you own first Quarto paper.\n\n# Install R and R Studio\n\nInstall [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads) on your laptop. All recent version of R Studio come along with Quarto already being included.\n\n# Create an R project for your paper\n\nIn R Studio go to,\n\n1.  File \\> New Project \\> New Directory\n\n2.  Scroll down and choose `Quarto Project`\n\n3.  Give your project a directory name, pick a location on your laptop.\n\n![](projpaper.png){width=\"30%\"}\n\n# Start writing your paper in the file with the ending .qmd\n\n## Configuring the `YAML` header\n\nIn this header, you tell Quarto how to `Render` your paper in the formats `pdf`, `docx`, and `html`. A lot can be added to this `YAML` header (see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html), for example), I recommend you the following minimal set up to get started:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n---\ntitle: \"Some compelling title\"\nauthor: \n- name: Seraphine F. Maerz\n  affiliations:\n    - University of Melbourne, Australia\nformat: \n  pdf: \n    pdf-engine: pdflatex\n    colorlinks: true\n    link-citations: true\n    header-includes:\n      - \\usepackage{float}\n      - \\floatplacement{table}{H}\n  html: default\n  docx: default\nprefer-html: true\nbibliography: references.bib\nthanks: \"Please do not circulate.\"\nabstract: \"Here, we can add an informative and concise abstract.\"\nkeywords: \"List some keywords here.\"\n---\n```\n:::\n\n\nGive your paper a title, add your name, affiliation, etc. Before you can get started with the actual writing of your paper, two more things you need to do:\n\n1.  Add a `.bib file` to your project folder and call it references.bib. For more information about .bib files and how you get the papers and books you want to cite in bibtex format from Mendeley, Zotero, etc., see \\[here\\](<https://bibtex.eu/quarto/>).\n\n2.  Install `tinytex` via the Terminal (bottom left in R Studio) for pdf compilation with the following command line: `Quarto install tinytex`.\n\n## Writing text\n\nJust below the header (end of it is marked with `---`) you can now start with the text of your paper. Formatting in Quarto documents is simple and very similar to Markdown. For example, you can start with your first header by writing `# Introduction`. If you prefer to write in a similar environment as .docx, click on `Visual` in the top left corner. In the `Visual` mode, formatting and inserting images or tables is straightforward and similar to .docx. \n\n## Citing others and adding a list of references\n\nCiting others is easy as soon as you have these resources saved in your `.bib` file (see above). Simply write @ in front of the `.bib` citation key, e.g., @Maerz2023. The list of references is automatically added to the end of your paper.\n\n## Adding a plot created in `R`\n\nYou can add an `R code snippet` creating a plot or other figures and also reference it in the text with `@fig-name`. Here is a simple example to get started:\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: fig-name\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| message: FALSE\n#| fig-cap: \"Our nice plot\"\n\n# with #| you tell Quarto how to deal with your plot\n\n# For example, use the V-Dem dataset, offering 500 indicators on democracy\n# more info about the dataset: https://www.v-dem.net/\n# load the dataset via the R package vdemdata on the vdeminstitute github\n# install devtools package, then use this command:\n# devtools::install_github(\"vdeminstitute/vdemdata\")\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(vdemdata)  \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\n# prepare data (check out the V-Dem Codebook for more info about variables)\nvdem <- vdemdata::vdem %>%\n  filter(v2x_regime > 1) %>% # this variable goes from 0-3, all countries above 1 are democracies\n  select(country_name, year, v2x_polyarchy, v2smgovdom, v2smgovab, e_gdppc, v2x_regime) %>% # democracy, disinformation variables, GDP per capita, regime type\n  mutate(Democracy = v2x_polyarchy, # rename variables\n         Disinformation = pmax(v2smgovdom, v2smgovab), # construct new variables by maximum values per obs.\n         Disinformation = 0-Disinformation) %>% # flip variables\n  drop_na()\n\n# do some simple plot\nggplot(vdem, aes(x = Disinformation, y = Democracy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\n  \n```\n\n\n## Adding a results table from estimations in `R`\n\nYou can add an `R code snippet` showing a results table summarizing your analysis and also reference it in the text with `@tbl-results`. Here is an example to get started: \n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: tbl-results\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| message: FALSE\n#| tbl-cap: \"Results table\"\n\n# with #| you tell Quarto how to deal with your table\n\n# For example, use the V-Dem dataset, offering 500 indicators on democracy\n# more info about the dataset: https://www.v-dem.net/\n# load the dataset via the R package vdemdata on the vdeminstitute github\n# install devtools package, then use this command:\n# devtools::install_github(\"vdeminstitute/vdemdata\")\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(vdemdata)  \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\n# prepare data (check out the V-Dem Codebook for more info about variables)\nvdem <- vdemdata::vdem %>%\n  filter(v2x_regime > 1) %>% # this variable goes from 0-3, all countries above 1 are democracies\n  select(country_name, year, v2x_polyarchy, v2smgovdom, v2smgovab, e_gdppc, v2x_regime) %>% # democracy, disinformation variables, GDP per capita, regime type\n  mutate(Democracy = v2x_polyarchy, # rename variables\n         Disinformation = pmax(v2smgovdom, v2smgovab), # construct new variables by maximum values per obs.\n         Disinformation = 0-Disinformation) %>% # flip variables\n  drop_na()\n\n# do some simple OLS \nm1 <- lm(Democracy ~ Disinformation + v2x_regime + e_gdppc, data = vdem) # DV: Democracy, IV: Disinformation, plus controls: GDP per capita, regime type\nmodelsummary(m1, estimate = \"{estimate}{stars}\") # for getting a nice table with stars\n```\n\n\n\n# Click `Render` and enjoy your nice paper in `pdf`, `.docx`, or `html`\n\nAfter these four basic steps, you might like to adjust your paper further. For example, you can add a `.csl` file to your folder and add it to the `YAML` header to automatically get journal-specific formatting and citation styles for your paper. You can also format your `pdf` file differently than your `.docx` (yes, some journals still accept only `.docx` files in old-fashioned formatting, don't ask me why). Quarto has a lot to offer for us academics and clicking `Render` and looking at your nice paper is fun!\n",
