**Please bring your laptops and have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://posit.co/downloads) installed!**

This seminar will be a brief hands-on tutorial on how to get started in R (e.g., by doing a simple regression analysis and some diagnostics) and how to integrate this R code into a R Markdown file for an efficient, all-in-one workflow of writing research papers. Be ready to get your hands dirty!
